Sigmund Freud was an Austrian neurologist and is one of the most renowned psychologist in the world.

When the the Nazi Party took control of Germany they burned Sigmund Freud's books he said, *"What progress we are making. In the Middle Ages they would have burned me. Now, they are content with burning my books."*

He was a *'glass is half full'* kind of optimistic guy.

They weren't content with just that. He was actually on the Nazi's "kill on sight" list for if they occupied the UK.
Little did they know by the time the Nazis got around to writing that list he was already dead.... but still. 
Another fun fact about Sigmund Freud is that when he had to sign a statement saying he was not mistreated by the Gestapo before he was allowed to leave, he supposedly facetiously wrote "I highly recommend the gestapo to everyone." Anyway years later after his death they found that form and apparently he didn't write that but just told everyone he did which is even funnier

One of Freud’s students, Wilhelm Reich , fled Europe during WWII and ended up in the US where the FDA burned all of his books because they didn’t agree with Reich’s thinking.

That only means we’re approaching the era where we burn the people who read the books.
