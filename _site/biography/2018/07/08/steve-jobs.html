  <p>Here’s to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes… the ones who see things differently – they’re not fond of rules… You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can’t do is ignore them because they change things… they push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.<br />
<em>- Steve Jobs</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We all know who Steve Jobs is–he’s the genius who revolutionized modern technology and the mastermind who emphasized style as much as function in our everyday digital device. He built Apple into the world’s most valuable company and while he was at it, he transformed several other industries.</p>

<h3 id="he-was-adopted">He was adopted</h3>
<p>His biological father, Abdulfattah Jandali, grew up in Syria and met his biological mother, Joanne Schieble at the University of Wisconsin. At the age of 23, they both thought it was too young to marry and having a child out of wedlock was unconventional so they gave their baby to Steve’s adoptive parents, Paul and Clara. They raised him on the promise that he would go to college.</p>

<h3 id="he-was-a-college-dropout">He was a college dropout</h3>
<p>Jobs graduated from Homestead High School in Silicon Valley, but dropped out of Reed College in Oregon because he didn’t want to spend his parent’s money. Although he did attend some classes, including calligraphy. In his 2005 commencement speech for Stanford University, Jobs stated that if he didn’t drop into that class the Mac wouldn’t have had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.</p>

<h3 id="he-experimented-with-psychedelics">He experimented with psychedelics</h3>
<p>Jobs experimented with LSD a few times claiming that it was a “profound experience” and “one of the most important things” in his life. He claimed it helped him to think differently.</p>

<h3 id="hewlett-packard-offered-jobs-a-summer-job">Hewlett Packard offered Jobs a summer job</h3>
<p>When Jobs was 12 years old, HP co-founder Bill Hewlett offered him a summer job after Steve called him asking for parts for an electronics project. It was known that Jobs had a keen interest in engineering from a young age as he used to help his guardian, Paul, fix things on his workbench.</p>

<h3 id="he-was-fired-from-apple">He was fired from Apple</h3>
<p>Jobs was fired because Pepsi Executive John Sculley told the board that he was far too young. This was after Jobs recruited him. Jobs then started another project creating the NeXT computer, but sales were limited because it was too expensive.</p>

<p>Apple purchased NeXT stock resulting in Steve returning to Apple.</p>

<p>There is a silver lining to this story - the combination of NeXT hardware with Apple resulted in operating systems like iOS used for the iPhone.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/jobs-2.jpg" alt="iwata" /></p>

<h3 id="pixar-made-him-a-billionaire">Pixar made him a Billionaire</h3>
<p>Have you ever wondered who Steve Jobs became a billionaire? Everyone assumes all of his money came from Apple, but his bank account actually made the biggest jump on a whole other project. Jobs was a majority shareholder of Pixar, previously know as the Graphics Group.</p>

<h3 id="he-was-a-tough-boss">He was a tough boss</h3>

<p>He followed strict rules and principles.  He believed in being strict to follow that.</p>

<h3 id="he-has-a-dedicated-team-to-study-emotions">He has a dedicated team to study emotions</h3>

<p>Jobs has a dedicated team to study the excitement and emotion behind opening a box and finding the products inside. This emotion is very common with Apple products today.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/jobs-3.jpg" alt="iwata" /></p>

<h3 id="he-patented-all-his-inventions">He patented all his inventions</h3>

<p>Steve Jobs had close to 300 patents under his name. The glass staircase at the Apple store is one such patented attraction that pulls passers-by into the store.</p>

<h3 id="he-is-buried-in-an-unmarked-grave">He is buried in an unmarked grave</h3>
<p>Jobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003. He tried natural alternative healing such as becoming a vegan, acupuncture, and herbal remedies. He resisted medicine. Jobs died at his home in Palo Alto with his family at his side. His final words were “Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow.”</p>
